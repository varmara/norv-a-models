RData objects for predictive models of total hydrocarbon concentration and Shannon-Wiener diversity around the offshore oil platforms in the North Sea

- __THC_mod.RData__ --- an RData object of class "gamm" with a final generalized additive mixed model of hydrocarbon concentration.
- __H_mod.RData__ --- an RData object of class "gamm" with a final generalized additive mixed model of Shannon-Wiener diversity index
